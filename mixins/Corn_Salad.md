Corn Salad
==========

* 2 Ears of corn
* 1 Lime, juiced
* Small handful of Cilantro, chopped
* A few green onions, chopped
* Garlic salt, or Garlic AND salt. I use Trader Joe's Garlic Salt in the grinder usually. 

Cut the corn off of the cob, and in a mixing bowl mix together corn, lime juice, chopped cilantro and garlic salt. You can tweak any of this stuff as desired.

This is my first Github commit. I'm glad it's taco related.
