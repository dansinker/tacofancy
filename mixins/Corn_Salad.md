Corn Salad
==========

* 2 Ears of corn
* 1 Lime, juiced
* Small handful of Cilantro, chopped
* A few green onions, chopped
* Garlic salt, or Garlic AND salt. I use Trader Joe's Garlic Salt in the grinder usually.

Cut the corn off of the cob, and in a mixing bowl mix together corn, lime juice, chopped cilantro and garlic salt. You can tweak any of this stuff as desired.
