Veggies for Fish Tacos
======================

Fish tacos are a special breed, requiring different vegetable options.

__Assemble your veg from the following options:__

* Cabbage, purple, shredded
* Cabbage, other shades, shredded
* Radishes, sliced into thin slices
* Red peppers, diced
* Cherry tomatoes, sliced (if you're a heathen)
* Cilantro, if it doesn't taste like soap to you

And one requirement:
* Limes, sliced for juicing over tacos.

Place out your selections and assemble into your taco. Then squeeze a lime over the top.
