Shredded Brussels Sprouts
=========================

## Description

A surprising, unexpected *and delicious* green addition to your taco!

You're not going to LOAD UP your taco with these, but they bring an amazing, mellow flavor to the mix. Especially good with fish tacos.

## Ingredients

* brussels sprouts
* butter

## Directions

1. Shred up your brussels sprouts so that they're flaked up. You're really going for almost a slaw-level shredding here.
2. Put a healthy amount of butter in a pan, melt it down with a little salt too.
3. Toss the shredded sprouts in, and fry 'em up until parts of them are browned up, and other parts have turned into a bright green. You're going for partial caramelization, but not all the way.
