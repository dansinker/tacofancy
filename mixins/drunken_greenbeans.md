Drunken Green Beans
===================

Green beans are fine. Green beans cooked in beer are better. Maybe even the best.

* 1 Surly fist full of green beans
* half a beer
* quarter cup vegetable broth
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1 Tbsp olive oil
* some salt, whatever

First peel and dice the garlic and saut√© it in the olive oil. Before it gets all burned and ruined, add the beer and vegetable broth. 
  
As the liquid comes to a boil, cut the green beans up. Add the green beans and a pinch of salt and let them simmer for about five minutes. If you like your beans on the softer side you can let it go a little longer. But the trick is to pull them right after the color starts to turn and you've just made a delicious addition to any taco.
