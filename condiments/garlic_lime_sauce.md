Garlic Lime Sauce
=====================

This sauce packs a creamy, sour, garlicky punch and can cut the heat on a spicy salsa. It pairs well with Mango Lime Salsa for excellent fish tacos. This is a simplified version of the [lime sauce recipe](http://www.loveandoliveoil.com/2008/04/fish-tacos-with-mango-salsa.html) on Love and Oil.

Combine in a bowl:
* 1-2 tablespoons mayonnaise
* 1/2 cup plain yogurt
* 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
* 1-2 cloves minced garlic
* salt to taste
* (optional): chopped fresh cilantro garnish

Whisk ingredients together in bowl.

Serve on the side, or drizzle as a decorative layer onto prepared tacos. Optionally sprinkle with chopped cilantro as garnish.
