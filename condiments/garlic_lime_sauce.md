Garlic Lime Sauce
=====================

This sauce packs a creamy, sour, garlicky punch and can cut the heat on a spicy salsa. It pairs well with Mango Lime Salsa for excellent fish tacos. This is a simplified version of the [lime sauce recipe](http://www.loveandoliveoil.com/2008/04/fish-tacos-with-mango-salsa.html) on Love and Oil.
