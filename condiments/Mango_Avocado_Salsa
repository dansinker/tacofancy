Mango Avocado Pico de Gallo

Ingredients:

1 c. small cubes of mango (about 1 medium to large RIPE mango - not too mushy, though)  
1 small avocado, cubed 
1/2-1 large jalapeno pepper (1/2 without seeds will give you a nice, mild-medium heat - add from there)  
1/4 c. chopped cilantro  
1/4 of a medium red onion, finely chopped  
Juice of 1 lime  
2-3 cloves garlic, minced  
Kosher or sea salt to taste  
Dash of chipotle pepper flakes or chipotle tabasco sauce if smoke is your thing

Instructions:

Combine ingredients. Best served immediately, but will keep for a day. Excellent topping for fish or chicken tacos, or served just with chips.
