Salsa de Aguacate
==========

This is the traditional green sauce served from a Mexican taco cart. Very popular with Tacos al Past√≥r or Tacos de Canasta, it is a creamy, green sauce. It has avacado, but it by no means a guacamole. Usually available with other taco cart staples such as: sliced radishes, spicy salsa roja, fresh cilantro, and fresh limes.

* 1/2 Kilo of Green Tomatillos (~1lb.)
* 2 green Serrano peppers (optional for heat)
* 1 avacado
* 2 limes
* 1/2 cup crema (Mexican sour cream, thinner and sweeter than standard sour cream)

Cook the tomatillos and peppers in a pot with water until soft. Drain the water out and let cool.

Put tomatillos, peppers, salt, lime-juice, crema, and avacado (shelled and pitted) in blender. With lid on, blend until completely mixed and liquid consistency. Salsa should be the consistency of crema, liquid, yet slightly viscous.

Pour over your tacos liberally. Refrigerate between uses.
