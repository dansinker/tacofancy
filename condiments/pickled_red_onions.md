Pickled Red Onions
==================

## Description

My wife made this recipe up, after eating something similar, but if you are making brisket tacos, it is the most wonderful accessory.

## Ingredients

* Vinegar
* 2 chopped red onions
* 1 tablespoon of sugar
* a dash of chili powder

## Directions

1. Chop the red onions into rings and put them into a container of vinegar. Add the sugar and store the mixture in your refrigerator to marinate and pickle, the longer the better.
1. Pick out the rings and place them on your brisket taco. Eat.
