Guacamole (Simple)
=========

If you're not in the mood to be fussy, this could be considered a minimum-viable guacamole recipe.

* 2 ripe avocados
* 2-4 limes, depending on juiciness, delivering 2-4T of lime juice
* 1 diced tomato (seeded if it's a big one)
* salt (to taste)
* hot sauce (to taste; Frank's Red Hot is a standard, but go with what you like)

1. Scoop the avocado meat into a bowl and mash them with a fork. Leave it a bit lumpy as we will do more stirring in a bit and we don't want to over-work them.
2. Add the chopped tomato.
3. Add the lime juice; hold some back for later adjustment).
4. Add ½t salt.
5. Add 2T hot sauce.
6. Stir with the fork again.
7. Taste.
8. Adjust salt/lime/hot sauce as desired.

This recipe will support one average-size bag of chips, so adjust quantities based on expectations.
