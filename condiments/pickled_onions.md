No taco is complete without fresh pickled onions. 

Ingredients:
* 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
* 1 cup water
* 1 tablespoon cane sugar
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 1 red onion
* 1 sprig fresh oregano

Couldn't be easier. 
  
Get two jars of the same size. To the first jar add the water, salt, vinegar, and sugar (cane surgar or brown sugar — NOT white sugar.) Shake the crap out of it until it's all disolved. In the other jar, add the oregano, then thinly slice the onion and jam it all on top of the oregano. Pour the jar of brine over the onion. Let it sit at least an hour, then taco it up. 
  
I've heard these can last for up to two weeks in your fridge, but I'm calling bullshit on that. Eat within a week. 
  
**Note: ** This brine also works well to pickle green beans, jalepeño, etc. But for that let it sit overnight. And for jalepeño you can add parboiled carrots because it cuts the heat a little without killing the flavor.
