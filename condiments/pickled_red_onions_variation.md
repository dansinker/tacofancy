# Pickled Red Onions Variation

## Description

Pickled onions are a favorite in the Von Doom house, too. [@littlewhirl](http://twitter.com/littlewhirl) played around with a similar starting point and we use this brine instead:

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
* 1 T Sugar (I usually use coconut palm sugar because I'm a hippie I guess)
* Water
* 1 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 sprig fresh oregano and/or cilantro (optional)

## Directions

1. Slice 1 red onion on a mandolin (WORTH IT).
1. In a bowl melt the sugar and salt with some warm/hot water.
1. Add vinegar and 1c of filtered water.
1. Add in onion, top off w/ water so that the onion is just covered.
1. VERY IMPORTANT: Let sit at room temp for at least an hour. Trust me.

## Notes

* The apple cider vinegar is a tangier but also more subtle, keeping more of the onion flavor there. And using a partial salt water brine lets it work nice for quick pickles, but also for slightly longer engagements. Leading to the most important aspect.
* PICKLE ALL THE THINGS
  * Seriously. All the things. Pickle your fridge. Pickle your waffles. Make. Lots. Of. Pickles.
  * __Cabbage__ — red or green work. You only need an hour or so (like onions)
  * __Jalepeños__ — seriously GTFO these are good. Add dill for a twist. Add parboiled carrots if you want to cut the spice
  * __Greenbeans__ — because greenbeans are goddam delicious
  * __Toy cars — kid with an attitude? Pickle their favorite toy car. Let's see them try to cop a tude when their matchbox cars are soggy and briney
  * __Cauliflower__ — personal favorite. Pickles in an hour, super delicious
  * __Baby corn__ — baby corn is gross, but if you pickle it you can make jokes about how big all the other things you pickled are
