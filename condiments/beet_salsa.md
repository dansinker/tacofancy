Beet Salsa
==========

Tired of plain ol' [Carne Asada Tacos](../base_layers/chooped_steak.md)? Get exotic with beet salsa.

* 4 - 6 Roma tomatoes
* 1 - 2 Serrano pepper
* Reasonably sized onion (green or vidalia)
* 10 garlic cloves (leave it up to your buds, I like 10 or more)
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 1 bunch of beets
* 1 or more lemons

Fry tomatoes, pepper(s), onion and garlic in a pan until they are brown and tomato skins are peeling away. Move ingredients to the blender and pur√®e. Chop beets to a blendable size and add to salsa. Add salt and pepper to taste. Squeeze in desired amount of lemon and blend one more time.
