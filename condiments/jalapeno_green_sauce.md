Jalape単o Green sauce
====================

* 6 large, fresh jalape単os, about 1/2 lb
* 1/4 large yellow onion
* 2 large garlic cloves
* 1/2 - 3-4 C. corn oil, OR sunflower oil, OR grape-seed oil
* 1 tsp salt

1. In a small pot bring water to a boil, enough water to cover the chiles and a
piece of onion. Simmer the jalape単os and onions for about 15-20 mins until they
change color and are fork tender, but not mushy. Carefully remove the stems after
they cool down a bit and strain some of the excess water.
2. Blend the corn oil, salt, garlic cloves, strained jalape単os, onions and salt.
3. Blend until smooth and creamy; frothy and pale green.
4. Taste for salt, refrigerate.

**It will last for a week... if you can contain yourself!**

Note: This sauce is spicy when warm, once it's refrigerated, the extra spice will settle!
