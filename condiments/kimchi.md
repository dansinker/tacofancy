Homemade Kimchi
=========

## Description

Kimchi will take your taco in a decidedly unrestrained asian direction, but comfort zones were made to be broken. It takes some time to make, as fermentation needs to take place. It also may take some time to acquire a taste for it, but it's worth the effort.

## Ingredients

* 1 napa cabbage
* 1/2 cup kosher salt
* 12 cups cold water (more if needed)
* 8oz daikon radish, cut into matchstick-size strips.
* 4 scallions, cut into 1-inch pieces
* 1/3 cup Korean red pepper powder
* 1/4 cup fish sauce
* 1/4 cup minced fresh ginger
* 1 tablespoon minced garlic
* 2 teaspoons minced Korean salted shrimp
* 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar

## Directions

1. Split the cabbage in half lengthwise, then crosswise into 2-inch pieces; discard the root. Put the cabbage into a large bowl with the salt and toss until the salt is evenly distributed. Add cold water to cover, making sure the cabbage is submerged. Cover with saran wrap and let it sit at room tempurature anywhere form 12-24 hours.
2. Drain the cabbage and rinse in cold water. Gently squeeze to get as much liquid out as you cam, and set the cabbage aside in a smaller bowl.
3. Add the remaining ingredients to the large bowl and mix it all up. Add the cabbage and toss until the cabbage is thoroughly covered.
4. Pack it all into a 2 quart glass jar and close it up. Make sure you get a tight seal.
5. Stick the jar in a dark place for about 24 hours. Open the lid to let out the gasses that have been wanting to get out, then close it up again and put it in the fridge.
6. Wait two more days, and voila, you have kimchi. Some people sya that it's best to wait at least a week before eating; it will last about a month.

## Notes

* Lots of other vegetables can be added; play around with it.
* Thanks to Momofuku, we know that pur√©eing kimchi takes a lot of the sweater smell out of it, and creates a smoother and rounder flavor, and is fantastic for squeezing onto tacos.
