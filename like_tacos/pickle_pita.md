# Pickle Pita Taco (not really a taco)

A sort of taco for when you're hungry, but not super coordinated.

## Ingredients

1. An unopened pita
2. A pickle, preferably whole, but really - any pickle will do.
3. A slice of cheese

## What to do

1. Put the slice of cheese on the pita. On top, don't open the pita. Pretend it's like flatbread or a Chalupa.
2. Put that in the microwave for 5-15 seconds depending on how powerful your microwave is and how melty you like your cheese.
3. Put the pickle in the middle of the melty cheese.
4. Fold the warm melty pita bread over the pickle. Eat like a taco.

## FAQ

> Could you make this into a taco by replacing the pita with a corn tortilla?

Yes, you could, but it would be less delicious.
