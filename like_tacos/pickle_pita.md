# Pickle Pita Taco (not really a taco)

A sort of taco for when you're hungry, but not super coordinated.

## Ingredients

1. An unopened pita
2. A pickle, preferablywhole, but really - anypickle will do.
3. A slice of cheese

## What to do

1. Put the slice of cheese on the pita.On top,don't open the pita.
Pretend it's like flatbread or a Chalupa.
2. Put that in the microwave for 5-15 seconds depending on how
powerful your microwave is and how melty you like your cheese.
3. Put the pickle in the middleof the melty cheese.
4. Foldthe warm melty pita bread over the pickle. Eat like a taco.
