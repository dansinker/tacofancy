Writing for Tacofancy
====================

Object-Oriented Tacos
--------------------
* Here at Tacofancy, we're writing _object-oriented_ taco recipes â€” each part of a taco is its own taco object that can be combined (or re-combined) into full tacos.
* That means that to create a [full taco](/full_tacos) recipe, you will actually create a few different taco objects, like a [base layer](/base_layers), some [mixins](/mixins), a [condiment](/condiments) or two, and even a [seasoning](/seasonings), and then combine them in the [full taco](/full_tacos) recipe.
* A great example of this is the [Pulled Pork, Chard, and Pickled Onion Tacos](/full_tacos/pork_chard_onion.md), which were assembled entirely from taco objects (in this case, two base layers and one condiment).
* If you submit a taco that doesn't abide by this object-oriented philosophy, we'll toss it back to you for reformatting, so do go ahead and do this step from jump.

File formatting
--------------
* Write your recipes in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)
* Follow the template specified in the [RECIPE_TEMPLATE.md](RECIPE_TEMPLATE.md) file
* Please name your files with underscores_in_place_of_spaces so that links remain readable and aren't%20full%20of%20bullshit.
* Give your files the .md extension.

Tags
----
* We support tagging of your recipe!
* Currently the only tags that that we recognize are "vegetarian" and "vegan", they result in a recipe being marked in a (v) in the [index](/INDEX.md)
* We require you follow the format:
  * tags: firsttag, secondtag, thirdtag, yougetthepicture
* If you'd like to add additional tags to your recipe, you can.

Submit
------
* Submit a pull request.
* We'll check it over, offer any suggestions if necessary (never about deliciousness, but possibly about formatting or because you forgot to update the index or something), and will then merge into master.
* You are wonderful.

Note for older Tacofancy contributors

* The index is now generated automatically (courtesy of @knowtheory) and no longer needs to be updated with your pull request.
