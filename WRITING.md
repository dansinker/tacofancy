Writing for Tacofancy
====================

Object-Oriented Tacos
--------------------
* Here at Tacofancy, we're writing _object-oriented_ taco recipes — each part of a taco is its own taco object that can be combined (or re-combined) into full tacos.
* That means that to create a [full taco](/full_tacos) recipe, you will actually create a few different taco objects, like a [base layer](/base_layers), some [mixins](/mixins), a [condiment](/condiments) or two, and even a [seasoning](/seasonings), and then combine them in the [full taco](/full_tacos) recipe.
* A great example of this is the [Pulled Pork, Chard, and Pickled Onion Tacos](/full_tacos/pork_chard_onion.md), which were assembled entirely from taco objects (in this case, two base layers and one condiment).
* If you submit a taco that doesn't abide by this object-oriented philosophy, we'll toss it back to you for reformatting, so do go head and do this step from jump.

File formatting
--------------
* Please write your recipes in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)
* Please name your files with underscores_in_place_of_spaces so that links remain readable and aren't%20full%20of%20bullshit.
* Give your files the .md extension.

Update the Index
----------------
* Once you have created all your various taco objects (even if it's just one) update the [index](INDEX.md) so that it gets listed. While we do have people checking every now and then, *you can help keep the index up-to-date* by updating your stuff as part of your pull request.

Submit
------
* Submit a pull request.
* We'll check it over, offer any suggestions if necessary (never about deliciousness, but possibly about formatting or because you forgot to update the index or something), and will then merge into master.
* You are wonderful.
