#Chicago Tacos

Because we're not all abuelitas. [Or have].

This section focuses on Taco avaliable south of Madison [really, Roosevelt] to the city limits.  Metadata needs to be filled in. Comment on what is worth order at each place. 

1. Birreria Zaragoza. Yes, everybody knows about it. Yes, it is that good. 49th and Pulaski. 
2. Zacatacos. A pocho style place, great carne asada. I prefer the 59th St. Location. [59th & Pulaski]
3. Palenque. Pollos a la brasa [aka a whole grilled chicken for around 10$]. One chicken, rice, beans, et cetra. Smokey as good good barbaque. [55th and California]
4. Taqueria Atotoniloco. The offshoot of the best tortilleria in the city (sorry, el Milargro fans), has a couple locations. Best is the one near 47 & Ashland (aka, a block from the tortilleria). Good variety, Al Pastor (really, adobada) is great. Get the fresh juices and a pack of tortillas to go. 
5. La Cesina.
