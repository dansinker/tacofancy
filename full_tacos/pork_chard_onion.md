Pulled Pork, Chard, and Pickled Onion Tacos
===========================================

Tried this combination out tonight, and it turned out amazing.

You'll need the following taco objects:

* [Pulled Pork](/base_layers/crock_pot_pulled_pork.md)
* [Swiss Chard](/base_layers/swiss_chard.md)
* [Pickled Onions](/condiments/pickled_red_onions.md)

Combine these on a corn tortilla, add a dollop of sour cream and sriracha. Uh-mazing.
