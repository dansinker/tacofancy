# Heat-Seeking Taco
Contrary to its name, the heat seeker actually tries *not* to expend energy. This is a cheap (in the essence of the word) taco that can be enjoyed without having a full oven, stove or other resource consuming appliance in the home. Despite all this, the taco is known to find heated areas of debate, so consumer beware.

Ingredients:
1. Cili padis (Or Thai chillies). Very small peppers, sliced finely so as to resemble scallion
2. A spicy soup, carefully applied to your base of choice. Just gently pat the base with the soup, no need to drown it.
3. Carefully selected beads of lime, unpopped.
4. Now crush everything and quickly bring into full bed of lettuce, wrap tightly.
5. Consume.
