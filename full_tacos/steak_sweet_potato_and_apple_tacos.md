title: Steak, Sweet Potato and Apple Tacos
---

It was a cold, wet November night tonight and I wanted a good warm taco that had a little bit of a taste of fall to it. Sweet-potato is one of my go-to taco ingredients, and on a whim, I cut up an apple and added it in. OHMYGOD, that was a good move. This taco contains the following:

* [Chopped Steak](/base_layers/chopped_steak.html)
* [Sweet Potato and Apple Hash](/mixins/sweet_potato_and_apple_hash.html)
* Guacamole
* Tomatoes
* Sour Cream
* Sriracha

They were really good.
