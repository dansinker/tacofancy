Chorizo scramble (aka Mandy's Life-Saving Tacos)
=========================================================

These breakfast tacos have the power to resurrect the dead. (If you do it the easy way they are excellent super-fast tacos.)

* [chorizo](/base_layers/chorizo.md) (that recipe is nice but you can just chop what you like straight off the sausage.)
* eggs
* [salsa verde](/condiments/simple_salsa_verde.md) (a primo verde is key.)
* chopped cilantro (gotta be fresh)
* slice o' lime (must also gotta be fresh)
* [corn tortillas](/shells/Fresh_corn_tortillas.md) (fresh is best but straight from the packet ain't never hurt nobody.)

1. Chop up and the chorizo and scramble a couple of eggs per serving.
2. Sweat the chorizo, then add the eggs to the pan.
2. Scramble the eggs and chorizo until they are awesome. (Pull them just before they're done, you don't want them rubbery.)
3. Warm the tortillas in another pan.
4. Add the chorizo scramble to a tortilla, add salsa verde, top with cilantro and a squeeze of lime.

Your life has been given back to you. Make the most of it.
