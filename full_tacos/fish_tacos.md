Fish Tacos
==========

Fish tacos tend to operate a little differently than other meat tacos. To execute them effectively, you'll want to assemble:

1. Your tortillas - corn are acceptable, flour can be acceptable if you're a bad person.
2. Your fish. Recipes can cover [traditional fried](/base_layers/battered_catfish.md) or [oven fried](/base_layers/baked_tilapia.md)
3. [Acceptable options for vegetables](/mixins/veg_for_fish_tacos.md)
4. Sauce, like [chipotle sauce](/condiments/chipotle_sauce.md)
5. Siracha or other hot sauce
6. Avocado or Guacamole

Warm taco shells and assemble tacos. Double shelling is more than acceptable.
