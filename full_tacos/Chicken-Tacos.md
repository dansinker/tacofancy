These super-easy tacos simplify weeknight dinner prep with store-bought ingredients. Just fill taco shells with rotisserie chicken, your favorite salsa, and grated cheese for a quick and easy dinner solution.

*Ingrediants*

- 1 store-bought rotisserie chicken
- 2 cups store-bought red or green salsa
- 8 taco shells
- 1 cup (4 ounces) grated Cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese
- 8 sprigs fresh cilantro (optional)
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 1 avocado, chopped
- 1 lime, quartered

*Preparation*

- Remove the meat from the chicken and shred. Heat the salsa in a skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and heat until warmed through. Fill the taco shells with the chicken mixture and top with the cheese and cilantro (if using). Serve with the sour cream, avocado, and lime wedges on the side.

- **Tip**: You can use soft corn or flour tortillas instead of crisp taco shells, or leftover roast beef or pork in place of chicken.
