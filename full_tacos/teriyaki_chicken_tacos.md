## Ingredients
* 1 bottle Teriyaki marinade or sauce

* 4-6 taco size flour tortillas
* 2 cups shredded Montery Jack cheese
* 1 1/4 cups cooked rice
* [Grilled pineapple pear salsa](../condiments/grilled_pineapple_pear_salsa.md)
* [Pineapple lime crema](../condiments/pineapple_lime_crema.md)

## Directions
* Place the [basic shredded chicken](../base_layers/basic_shredded_chicken.md) in a medium bowl, pour 1/2 bottle of Teriyaki sauce into the bowl and mix well.
* Heat up tortillas in a medium pan with a little bit of butter on medium-low heat. While the tortilla is heating up, place a little bit of rice on the tortilla, then top with some cheese so the cheese will melt slightly.
