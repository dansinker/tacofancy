Sriracha Salt
=============

I actually received this as a gift, but I found a recipe to make your own.

__Ingredients__

* 1 cup Salt
* 10 tsp. Sriracha

Mix the two ingredients together in a bowl. Spread it out on a baking sheet lined with foil or parchment paper. Put in a 200-degree oven, then turn the oven off and let it sit overnight inside. It will clump, but place in ziplock bag and attack it with a rolling pin. Tada!

The effect on most food is as awesome as you'd expect but it is especially amazing with eggs. Add it to your breakfast tacos.
