Universal Taco Seasoning
========================

I got tired of buying packets of store-bought taco seasoning, so I experimented with various spices and ratios until I landed on this recipe. I keep a jar of it in the cupboard at all times.

* 6 tbsp chili powder
* 4 tbsp cumin
* 4 tbsp corn starch
* 3 tbsp onion powder
* 1 tbsp salt
* 1 tbsp garlic powder
* 4 tsp oregano (Mexican oregano, if you've got it)
* 2 tsp crushed red pepper

Combine in Mason jar and shake well to combine.

This mix works well for chicken, pork and beef, destined for the grill, oven, slow cooker or stovetop. You could tweak it a bit to target a specific meat, but I like to have a base, universal mix around. Makes it super easy to turn leftover anything into delicious taco filling: Just chop up whatever it is, toss it into a skillet, sprinkle generously with seasoning, then add a bit of water and simmer to impart flavor.
