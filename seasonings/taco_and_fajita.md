Kathy's Taco and Fajita Seasoning
=================================

My cousin Kathy sent me this recipe for my birthday:

Amazing taco/fajita seasoning – Use with any protein.  It's a great recipe to quadruple so you have it ready for immediate taco needs. When making a big batch, use less salt.

Combine:

2 tsp cumin
1 tsp EACH: paprika, onion powder, dried oregano, and kosher salt
½ tsp EACH: ground coriander, garlic powder and black pepper
¼ tsp EACH: red pepper flakes, ground ginger and cayenne pepper
