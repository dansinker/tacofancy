Hard Corn Shells (Traditional; US)
======================

Mistakenly thought by many to be traditionally Mexican, hard shells were actually popularized in the US in the mid-20th century.

While they can certainly be made at home (if you have access to a deep-fryer), the best method of obtaining hard taco shells is to head to the grocery store.
