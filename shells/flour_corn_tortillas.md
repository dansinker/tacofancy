Flour Corn Tortillas
====================


This recipe modified from [Chris Scheuer's at **The Café Sucré Farine**](http://thecafesucrefarine.com/2013/08/best-ever-homemade-flour-tortillas/).

Yields: Approximately 16 tortillas
Prep time: 20 min
Total time: 1 hour

**Ingredients:**

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 cup instant corn masa mix
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/3 cup vegetable oil
* 1 cup warm water (approximate)


If you enjoy a slight corn taste but want a fluffier shell, try this recipe which uses both flour and masa mix.

I've only tried this once (and they were delicious) but I am still working on the best proportion of flour to masa mix so open an issue if you find a better ratio than 2:1.
