# Swiss Chard Tacos

Got chard or another leafy green from your CSA? Now you can have tacos

Components:
* [Cooked chard](/base_layers/swiss_chard.md)
* 1 onion sliced thin
* 1/2 cup of chicken broth
* crumbled queso fresco or crema
* salsa

Of course, you could decide you want to add some grilled chicken or steak. Or you could _make it Monteiro_ and add tofu or other soy products.
