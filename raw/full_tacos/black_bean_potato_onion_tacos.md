Black Bean, Potato, and Onion Tacos
===================================

Vegetarian; vegan if you omit the cheese
-----------------------------------------

* 1 recipe [Garlic Black Beans](/base_layers/garlic_black_beans.md) (broth left slightly soupy)
* Potatoes, peeled and sliced into rounds (best results with baby yellow, red, or purple/blue potatoes if you can get them)
* Large Onion, cut in half and sliced into half-moons
* Vegetable oil of your choice
* Salty cheese of your choice (cotija ftw)

1. Heat two tablespoons vegetable oil in large skillet over medium heat.
2. Once olive oil begins to shimmer, add onions. 
3. When onions start becoming translucent, turn the heat down a tiny bit and saute them until they turn very slightly brown on the edges. 
4. Add the peeled and sliced potato rounds and saute them along with the onions until the potatoes are fork-tender.
5. Add the garlic black beans and simmer until any bean broth is incorporated into the potato/onion mix.
6. Let cool a little bit before serving, potatoes retain heat really really well. 

Serve on corn or flour tortillas. Hard or soft shell, doesn't matter. Sprinkle on salty cheese as desired.
