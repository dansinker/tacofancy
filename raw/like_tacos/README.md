There is a whole world of foods that are similar, but aren't exactly tacos. This directory is dedicated to them. 

-----------------------------------------

From [@maxogden's gist](https://gist.github.com/maxogden/5906394): tacos are a category of food that are relatively small in size and are served on a open platform of thin carbohydrate filled material. things that make you want to sleep after eating or are sealed off when served are not tacos (see instead: burritos, pizza)

- [peking duck](http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/09/the-food-lab-how-to-make-peking-duck-at-home.html) which is usually served with [mushu pancakes](http://userealbutter.com/2013/02/13/mandarin-pancakes-mushu-shells-recipe/)

- [arepas](http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/04/latin-american-cuisine-colombian-arepas.html) - note: omit top half when serving for proper taco categorization
- [really small pizzas](http://www.thecomfortofcooking.com/2012/08/make-your-own-mini-pizzas.html) - if you make large pizzas they make you want to go to sleep after eating one which breaks the first rule of tacos
- [injera](http://www.veganricha.com/2013/03/ethiopian-injera-100-teff-flatbread.html) - make sure to subdivide into smaller diameter pieces
- [small crepes](http://peachykitchens.com/2013/03/17/eh-maslenitsa-my-mini-crepes-with-mushroom-filling/) - again the key is the size. also what is the different between a blintz and a crepe?
- [sushi](http://shizuokasushi.com/2009/08/17/sushi-rice-the-recipe-basics/) - as long as it is not served in complete rolls sushi is a taco. when served in rolls it is known as a [sushirrito](http://www.sushirrito.com/)
- [sopes and other antojitos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sope)
- [tacos](http://instagram.com/p/Yv6buoJr-_/) tacos are tacos as long as they 1) come from trucks in oakland or 2) are made by hand in front of you from masa flour

not tacos:

- hot dogs - not thin enough
- doner kebab - too heavy
