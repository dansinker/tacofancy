Basic Shredded Chicken
======================

This recipe creates enough shredded chicken for 2 to 3 meals. It's a savory, universal base; once cooked, you can supplement with any number of spices or treatments to make tacos, taquitos, soups, enchiladas ... even Italian or Indian applications if you like.

__In the Crockpot__

* 4-5 lbs. boneless skinless chicken breast
* 1 can chicken broth
* 1 tsp chili powder
* 1/2 tsp cumin
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp oregano
* kosher salt
* black pepper

Salt the chicken breasts (be reasonably generous here), then crack some black pepper over each. In your crockpot, mix garlic powder, chili powder, cumin and oregano into the broth. Place chicken in crockpot, then cook on low for 8 hours.

When the chicken is done, attack each piece with two forks to shred. Do this on a Sunday and you'll have an easy time putting together meals throughout the week.

I often give this a quick simmer with a bit of water and [universal taco seasoning](/seasonings/universal_taco_seasoning.md) for taco filling. Or throw it into tortilla soup. Or make some sweet [taquitos](/like_tacos/baked_taquitos.md). Or just add some barbecue sauce to a handful of chicken, and toss it onto a soft roll for a quick sandwich. Man *can* live on tacos alone, but one doesn't have to.
