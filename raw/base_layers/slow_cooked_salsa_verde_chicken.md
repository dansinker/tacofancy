Slow-Cooked Salsa Verde Chicken
===============================

Low-effort, delicious shredded chicken based off [this recipe](http://www.skinnytaste.com/2013/04/easiest-crock-pot-salsa-verde-chicken.html). To minimize prep time, just toss in a jar of storebought salsa verde.

* 2 lbs skinless chicken breasts
* 2 cups salsa verde
* 1 tsp minced garlic or 1/4 tsp garlic powder
* Pinch of Oregano _(Note: I ran out of Oregano, but the recipe still tastes great without it.)_
* Pinch of Cumin
* Salt, to taste

Add chicken to slow cooker and season with garlic, oregano, cumin and salt. Pour salsa verde over everything, cover and cook for two hours on high.

Once that's ready, shred chicken. Give it another stir to cover everything in sauce, then serve.
