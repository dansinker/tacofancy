# Slow Cooked No-Bean Chili

Super delicious and spicy no-bean chili made from scratch.

## Ingredients
* 1 kg / 2.2 lbs chuck steak
* 1 Garlic head
* Spice mix
    * 2 tbsp Flour
    * 1 tbsp Chili powder
    * 2 tsp Cumin powder
    * 2 tsp Coriander powder
    * 1 tsp Dried oregano
    * 1 tbsp Brown sugar
* Beer of your choice
* 2 Jalapeños
* 2 Dried ancho chili peppers
* 2 Dried chipotle chili peppers
* 1 Beef bouillon cube
* Oil, preferably corn oil
* A large cooking pot

## Instructions
1. Remove the stems and the seeds from the dried peppers. Cover them with water in a small pot and boil for 15 minutes.
1. Mix the peppers with the water until it transforms into a sort of chili sauce.
1. Finely chop the garlic and jalapeños.
1. Cut the beef in 2 cm cubes and sear them on high temperature in oil together with the garlic.
    * Protip: You'll get much better result if you don't sear all the beef at once.
1. Sprinkle the spice mix over the beef.
1. Lower the temperature and add the chili sauce we made in the beginning.
1. Add enough beer that it covers everything and throw in the boillion cube.
1. Cover the cooking pot and let it simmer a couple of hours until the meat is all stringy and nice.
    * Protip: Crack a bottle of beer, sit back and relax as this will take a while.
    * Protip: Lower temperature → longer cooking time → better result.
1. Remove the cover and reduce the liquid until the texture is perfect™.
1. Balance up the flavors with salt, black pepper and brown sugar.
    * Protip: A couple of dashes of soy sauce is nice if you're looking for a darker color.
