Better Than Powder Ground Beef
=====================

## Description

Did you grow up on Old El Paso ground beef taco seasonings? I'm sorry.  So did I.  They're terrible, right?  Here's something better.

## Ingredients

* sautee half-onion
* salt
* pepper
* ground cumin

## Directions

1. Brown a pound of ground beef, seasoning liberally with ground cumin, salt, pepper. Add tabasco/other hot sauce if you like.
1. When beef is browned, add a small jar of salsa (any kind!  i like corn/black bean tomato salsa), and simmer for 5-10 minutes.
1. Enjoy.  Serve with crispy taco shells for nostalgia.
