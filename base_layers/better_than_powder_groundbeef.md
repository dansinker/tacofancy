Did you grow up on Old El Paso ground beef taco seasonings?

I'm sorry.  So did I.  They're terrible, right?  Here's something better:

Dice a half-onion, sautee and season liberally with salt, pepper, and ground cumin.

Brown a pound of ground beef, seasoning liberally with ground cumin, salt, pepper.  Add tabasco/other hot sauce if you like.

When beef is browned, add a small jar of salsa (any kind!  i like corn/black bean tomato salsa), and simmer for 5-10 minutes.

Enjoy.  Serve with crispy taco shells for nostalgia.
