Corn and Black Beans
===================

This is a fork of the [Zuccini and Corn Filling](/base_layers/zucchini_corn.md) because I'm not a Zuccini fan. I also tweaked the spices. 

You'll need:

* Fresh corn kernels, cut off the cob. 
* 1 can of Black Beans
* half a white onion
* salt
* chili powder
* cumin

Directions
----------

1. Toast corn in a skillet over high heat with oil and salt for about 5 minutes, or until browned. Remove corn.
2. Cook onion in the skillet until it caramelizes (about 5 minutes). Leave onion in there.
3. Add corn back in.
4. Add black beans.
5. Toss in a pinch of salt, a healthy couple shakes of chili powder, and a small pinch of cumin.
6. Cook together for another 5 minute or so.

Delicious hot as the main base_layer or as a supplement to others.
