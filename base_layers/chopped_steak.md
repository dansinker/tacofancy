Chopped Steak
=============

I like all kinds of steak tacos, but lately have been into cubed up steak tacos that are allowed to marinate a little bit in some salsa verde and other spices. Here's the ones I made tonight:

* 1lb rib eye steak, cubed into ~1" cubes
* Salsa verde, your choice, about 2-3 Tbs
* Pinch or two of mexican oregano
* A few healthy sprinkles of chili powder

Cube up your steak, mix everything together, cover and let sit for a half hour or so.

When everything else is ready to go, pan-fry (or, skewer and grill if you're feeling ambitious), until cooked to your chosen meat level.
