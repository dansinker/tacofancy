Ground Beef (Traditional; US)
==================

The tranditional base for an American taco is ground beef, browsed in a skillet and seasoned.

* 1lb Ground Beef

1. Heat a skillet on the stovetop.
2. Brown the ground beef for 8-10 minutes, or until it is thoroughly cooked, stirring frequently to avoid sticking or burning. (If you're not using a non-stick pan, which is preferred, use 1T oil to keep things loose.)
3. Stir in seasonings.
