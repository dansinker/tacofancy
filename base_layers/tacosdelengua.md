Delengua (Beef Tongue)
======================

Entertaining? Wanna go exotic? Got a little bit of time? Makes in the neighborhood of 20 tacos.

__Ingredients__

* 1 1/2 pounds of cow tongue
* 1/2 onion
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 quart chicken stock
* 6 cilantro stems
* 1 small carrot, peeled and roughly chopped
* 2 cloves garlic
* 2 tablespoons Canola Oil

__Directions__

1. Combine tongue, onion, bay leaves, carrot, and garlic in a saucepan. 
2. Add stock until mostly covered. 
3. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a simmer, cover with lid, and cook four to six hours until completely tender (depends on the size of the tongue).
4. Add water as necessary to keep the tongue mostly submerged.
5. Move tongue to a cutting board. 
6. Strain stock and chuck the solids, keeping the liquid for later. 
7. Peel the outer membrane off the tongue and discard. Chop tongue into 1/2-inch pieces. 

When ready to serve, heat oil in a large non-stick skillet set over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add tongue and cook, stirring occasionally, until tongue is well browned on all sides, 5 to 8 minutes total. 

NOTE: The first seven steps can be done well in advance. Should keep in fridge up to five days.
