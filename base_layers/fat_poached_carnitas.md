Fat-Poached Carnitas
=====================

## Ingredients

* 3 pounds of boneless pork shoulder or uncured picnic ham (see note for how to select).
* 0.25 to 0.50 cups of liquified fat (oil, lard or duck fat is acceptable)
* 10 to 15 garlic cloves (roasted preferred)
* 1 lemon, sliced into thin circles and those are quartered
* coarse salt
* black pepper

## Directions

1. Heat oven to 250 degrees.
2. Cube pork shoulder in roughly 3-inch chunks.
3. Salt and pepper the cubes aggressively.
4. Stuff cubes tightly (very tightly) into the smallest, deepest baking dish available.
5. Stuff garlic and lemon between the cubes.
6. Pour fat over cubes to just cover.
7. Bake in oven for 5 hours.
8. Remove dish from oven.
9. Cover a sheet pan with foil.
10. With slotted spoon, remove the pork to the sheet pan and spread out in a single layer.
11. Turn on broiler.
12. Broil pork in sheet pan until it is somewhat blackened and crispy, probably 4-6 minutes. YMMV because broilers are ridiculous.
13. Remove from oven and tease with fork.

## Notes
* A nice thick fat cap on the top of the pork is preferable.
* Ask your butcher to remove any bones.
* Do not use cured meat.
