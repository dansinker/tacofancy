Bulgar Black Bean Filling
=========================

This is a quick and easy vegetarian substitute for a ground beef-like texture without using a soy substitute.

* 1 cup cooked, strained bulgar
* 1/3 cup cooked black beans (or canned), rinsed and strained.

Mix bulgar and black beans together. For better texture, slightly mash the black beans. Add your choice of seasonings to taste and serve.
