Chopped Pork
=============

This is a quick and easy way to prep and cook your pork for tacos.

You need:

* pork chops, boneless, don't go too crazy thick, around 1-2" tops.
* kitchen scissors

Do you see where this is going? Cut up your chops unevenly with the scissors. Go for an average of chopped bits around 1" in size or so, but variation is good, especially little bits. Those little bits are going to turn into crispy bits of goodness. When you..

Toss all this into a high-heat pan (cast iron, if you've got it) and fry it up so that it chars up real nice. The little bits will turn into little charred chunks--this is a feature, not a bug.

Prior to the pan-tossing, you should spice up your pork with a good rub or marinade. If you're looking, I recommend the [sriracha marinade](/seasonings/sriracha_marinade.md).
