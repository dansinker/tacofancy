Hey taco friends! My wife and I love to use Korean meats and seasonings in our tacos! Here's an example recipe:
- Corn tortillas
- Oil for frying tortillas (we use avocado oil)
- Bulgogi (marinated beef), teriyaki-marinated chicken breast, and/or spicy pork bulgogi (find in any Korean market!)
- Garlic, chopped
- Green onions, chopped
- Fresh basil, chopped
- Salsa Verde or guacamole
- Sriracha sour cream

Cook your meat of choice while heating a pan with oil. Fry the tortillas on med-high heat until lightly browned (approx. 1 minute each side). Remove tortillas and place on a paper towel to blot oil. Add meat and garnishes to taste. Serve with Sriracha sour cream and enjoy while hot!
