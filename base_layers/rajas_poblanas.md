Taco de rajas poblanas
======================

* Bunch of poblano peppers
* Onion
* Tad of oil
* Mexican crema or sour cream
* *optionally*, fresh corn
* *optionally*, queso Oaxaca or panela or fresco

Start with 1 or more produce-section bags of Poblano peppers,
it's handy if the bags are not totally full for a subsequent step.

Place the Poblano peppers over an open flame, typically directly
over a natural gas burner on a stove. Their skin will bubble and blister,
rotate and rearrange them with tongs until the burns, bubbles, and
blisters are evenly distributed around the chiles and you feel a tingle
in your upper sinuses. Put the singed peppers back in the produce bags,
then close the bags tightly to 'sweat' the chiles inside.

While the chiles are sweating, sautee some onion slices in a pan.
Optionally, add some pre-cooked whole kernels of corn when the onion is
almost done.

Take the chiles out of the bag. Their skin will be wilted and will come off
in your fingers. Peel the outer layer of the chiles off and discard. Once
the outer skin is removed, de-vein the rest and remove the seeds. Then
cut the flesh into thinninsh strips.

Add the chile strips (the 'rajas') back into the pan with the onion. Get it
all hot and finish cooking any bits of chile that remain raw after the
skin removal process. When it looks close to done, lower the cooking heat
to a minimum and add the cream and cheese(s) and warm them for about 5 minutes.
